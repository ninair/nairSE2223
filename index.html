                    <h1 id = "ovPadLeft">Background</h1>
                    <p class ="lead overview-font" id="ovPadLeft">Plastic pollution in marine ecosystems is a growing issue. 5.25 trillion plastic particles weighing a total of 268,940 tons (Eriksen et al. 2014) have been estimated to be floating at sea. These plastics cause serious harm to marine environments. Animal species  are affected by the ingestion of microplastics, which are defined as small plastic debris less 
                        than 5mm in diameter. Species from taxonomic groups with a variety of different feeding techniques mistake plastics for prey. Ingestion of plastic has been recorded in 44-50% of all seabirds, snakes, penguins, seals, sea lions, fish, crustaceans, and marine mammals. 
                        This ingestion leads to reductions in metabolic activity, reproduction, feeding rates, and immunity (Taylor et al. 2016). Microplastics ingested by marine organisms also pose a threat to humans as seafood introduces them to the human food chain. <br><br> Of various plastic types, polyethylene terephthalate(PET) is gaining use in drinking bottles and fabrics. 
                        However, the commercially desirable resistance of PET to natural degradation also causes it to accumulate in marine environments (Chen et al. 2018). The degradation of PET by biological factors is slowed by several chemical properties of the plastic.  
                        Considering these difficulties, several bacterial species that express extracellular enzymes are candidates for plastic degradation. Of these, members of the species <em>Micrococcus luteus</em> are of interest. This strain of bacteria has evolved to take advantage of available organic molecules from plastic sources, obtaining energy through degradation. 
                        Like other strains involved in biodegradation, M. Luteus degrades plastic through the process of biochemical transformation, expressing certain catalytic enzymes that break bonds in the larger polymer. For these reasons, <em>M. Luteus</em> has great potential in addressing plastic pollution.
                        <br><br>More recently, the soil-dwelling bacteria <em>Ideonella sakaiensis</em> has adapted to use the carbon from plastic sources using an enzyme called PETase. The structure of PETase is oriented specifically to a PET substrate.
                        PETase is effectively able to break down PET into monomers such as bis (2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), mono (2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET). Then these monomers can be further digested into 4 molecules (MHET, BHET, terephthalate, and ethylene glycol), 
                        which pose less threat to ecosystems compared with the bulky PET polymer (Joo et al. 2018).

                    <h1 id = "ovPadRight">Rationale</h1>
                    <p class ="lead overview-font" id="ovPadRight">These properties of microorganisms and their enzymes are crucial to determining how to best address plastic pollution. Current plastic waste prevention approaches include recycling, regular beach cleanups, and on a wider scale,
                         implementation of restrictions upon single-use plastics. However, none of these methods are effective to the degree to which the plastic issue can be fully addressed. The study of microorganisms has become a favorable alternative to these methods because microorganisms can degrade plastic in more sustainable ways. In addressing global environmental issues related to the use of finite resources, including fossil fuels, scientists favor sustainable systems such as these microorganisms, which have continual reuse. The enzymes secreted by microorganisms are environmentally friendly and can engage in degradation processes without interfering with the health of marine life. This is a crucial differentiator from man-made chemicals intended to perform the same functions. These enzymes have also been characterized as having higher efficiencies (Olasanmi and Thring 2018).
                         To fully take advantage of the capabilities of microorganisms for application in industrial settings, biotechnology must be used to enhance the properties of the strains and enzymes such as the aforementioned <em>M. luteus</em> strain and PETase.  The objective of this study was to determine how the rate at which <em>M. luteus</em> could degrade PET into its monomer units would change once 
                         the organism was genetically modified to express PETase, as demonstrated by its degradation rate of samples of PET in liquid culture.

                    <p class ="lead overview-font" id="ovPadLeft">Research Practicum is the final required research course at HTHS. In this three-marking period course, you will set up and conduct the research project you proposed in ITR.  During this course you are  required to meet with faculty mentors (and outside mentors if you are working in another facility), conduct your experiments, analyze and interpret your results and draw conclusions relevant to the rationale for your research. You will then write a comprehensive research paper, integrating the knowledge gained in both ITR and this course. At the end of this course all students are required to give a professional quality oral presentation of their work.  You will also have the opportunity to enter your research into competitions such as the 
                        Jersey Shore Science Fair and the New Jersey Academy of Science Symposium. In addition to research and data analysis skills, you will develop skills in communication, time management, organization, decision making, resource allocation, scientific ethics, and  lab safety.
