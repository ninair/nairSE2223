                    <p class="mb-1 procedure-paragraph">Members of M. luteus were cultured on NA plates for one week before transformation. The Micrococcus Luteus was delivered in the form of a nutrient agar slant culture. A sterile inoculation loop was used to select and then transfer bacteria onto a nutrient agar plate. The inoculation loop was dragged in a zigzag pattern to create a streak culture. The streak culture was left to incubate at 27°C for a week.  
                        Two groups of bacteria were present for the study: the positive control would not undergo transformation while the experimental group, selected from the same plate, would undergo transformation to contain the engineered plasmid and express PETase. 
                        Transformation was carried out following the instructions outlined in the Carolina transformation kit. Two sterile 15 mL tubes were used to contain two different conditions of bacteria: +plasmid and -plasmid, representing having and not having plasmid DNA added respectively. Using a micropipette, 250 µL of ice-cold calcium chloride was added to each of the tubes, which were then placed on ice. A streak of colonies from the previously prepared plate was transferred with a sterile inoculating loop to each tube, with the loop being spun vigorously  to release the bacterial contents into the tube. Following this, a micropipette was used to add 10 µL of isolated plasmid DNA to the +plasmid tube only. Both tubes were incubated for 15 minutes before heat shock. 
                        To perform heat shock, the tubes were kept on ice and carried to the water bath. Both tubes were removed from the ice and immediately immersed in 42°C water for 90 seconds. The tubes were subsequently returned to the ice for 1 minute.
                        After using a micropipette to add 250 µL of room-temperature LB to each tube, the tubes were placed at room temperature for ten minutes to recover.
                        To select for transformed cells, the bacteria in each tube were plated on NA + ampicillin along with NA plates which served as a control. Using a micropipette, 100 µL of cells from each tube were added to the center of an appropriately labeled plate. An L-spreader was used to spread the bacteria, creating a lawn. The plates were incubated for four days at 25°C before selection (Carolina Biologicals).
